# Numix UI Roadmap

## Guiding Principle: Inspiration from Original Numix Projects

Throughout the development of Numix UI, we aim to **closely reference and, where feasible, directly utilize or be heavily inspired by the SCSS and design principles of the original Numix desktop theme and related projects.** This ensures an authentic and consistent Numix experience on the web.

## Phase 1: Core Styling (Current - Initial Release)

**Goal:** Establish a solid foundation by replicating the core visual elements of the Numix desktop theme in CSS, **drawing inspiration from the original Numix SCSS structure and variables where applicable.**

**Key Deliverables:**

* **Basic Typography:** Define and implement Numix-inspired font stacks, sizes, weights, and styles for headings, body text, and other text elements. **Effort will be made to align font choices and sizing with the original theme's definitions.**
* **Color Palette:** Establish the primary, secondary, accent, and neutral color schemes based on Numix. Provide CSS variables for easy customization, **mirroring the color variables defined in the original Numix SCSS as closely as possible.**
* **Basic Form Elements:** Style input fields (text, email, password, etc.), textareas, checkboxes, radio buttons, and select dropdowns, **paying attention to the visual details and styling rules present in the original Numix form elements.**
* **Buttons:** Create styles for primary, secondary, default, and potentially other button variations with hover and active states, **aiming to replicate the gradients, borders, and overall appearance of Numix buttons.**
* **Basic Layout Components:** Implement basic grid or flexbox-based layout classes for simple page structures, **considering any underlying layout principles evident in Numix applications.**
* **Navigation:** Style basic navigation patterns like simple menus and potentially tabs, **observing the visual style and interaction cues of Numix navigation elements.**
* **Alerts and Notifications:** Design and implement styles for informative, warning, error, and success messages, **taking inspiration from the visual presentation of notifications in Numix.**
* **Documentation (Initial):** Basic documentation covering installation and usage of the core components, **potentially referencing similarities to Numix desktop elements.**
* **Initial Release (v0.1.0):** Public release of the core Numix UI library via CDN and potentially npm.

## Phase 2: Component Expansion (Next 3-6 Months)

**Goal:** Expand the library with more complex and commonly used UI components, further aligning with the Numix aesthetic by **analyzing and adapting the styling of comparable elements from the original Numix projects.**

**Key Deliverables:**

* **Cards:** Implement styles for card-based layouts with headers, bodies, and footers, **drawing inspiration from any card-like elements or container styles in Numix.**
* **Modals:** Create styles for modal dialogs with customizable content and actions, **replicating the visual structure and styling of Numix dialogs.**
* **Progress Bars and Spinners:** Design visual indicators for loading states and progress, **aiming for a similar visual style to Numix loading indicators.**
* **Tooltips and Popovers:** Implement styles for contextual information display on hover or click, **observing the design and behavior of similar elements in Numix.**
* **Pagination:** Style pagination controls for navigating through large datasets, **taking inspiration from any pagination patterns found in Numix applications.**
* **Tables:** Create basic styling for HTML tables, **adhering to the clean and readable style of Numix tables.**
* **Enhanced Navigation:** Implement more advanced navigation patterns like sidebars and dropdown menus, **closely mimicking the appearance and interaction of Numix navigation menus.**
* **Documentation (Expanded):** Comprehensive documentation with detailed usage examples for all components, **highlighting the connection to corresponding Numix desktop elements.**
* **Unit Testing:** Implement basic unit tests for core CSS functionality to ensure stability.
* **Release (v0.2.0 - v0.3.0):** Incremental releases with the new components and improvements.

## Phase 3: Theming and Customization (Next 6-12 Months)

**Goal:** Provide robust mechanisms for users to customize the Numix UI to better fit their specific needs, **leveraging the structure and variables of the original Numix SCSS to create a consistent theming experience.**

**Key Deliverables:**

* **Sass/SCSS Support:** Migrate the codebase to Sass/SCSS to enable easier theming and customization through variables and mixins, **directly utilizing or mirroring the variable naming conventions of the original Numix SCSS where sensible.**
* **Theme Variables:** Expose a comprehensive set of Sass/SCSS variables for colors, fonts, spacing, and other design tokens, **aiming for parity with the customization options available in the original Numix theme.**
* **Pre-built Themes (Optional):** Explore the possibility of creating alternative Numix-inspired themes (e.g., a dark theme), **potentially adapting existing Numix color schemes.**
* **Utility Classes:** Introduce a set of utility classes for common styling needs (e.g., margin, padding, text alignment, visibility), **while ensuring they complement the overall Numix aesthetic.**
* **Documentation (Theming):** Detailed documentation on how to customize the theme using Sass/SCSS variables and potentially pre-built themes, **referencing the original Numix theming concepts where applicable.**
* **Code Examples and Templates:** Provide more comprehensive code examples and basic HTML templates showcasing Numix UI in different layouts, **demonstrating how the theme variables can be used.**
* **Release (v0.4.0 - v0.5.0):** Releases focused on theming capabilities and utility classes.

## Phase 4: Advanced Components and Features (Long-Term)

**Goal:** Explore and implement more advanced UI components and features based on community feedback and evolving web development trends, **always keeping the visual language and design principles of Numix as the primary inspiration.**

**Potential Deliverables:**

* **Carousels and Sliders:** Implement styles for image or content carousels, **drawing inspiration from any similar elements in Numix-related projects.**
* **Accordions and Collapsibles:** Create styles for expandable content sections, **aiming for a visual style consistent with Numix UI's other components.**
* **Date and Time Pickers (Basic Styling):** Provide basic styling that can be enhanced with JavaScript libraries, **ensuring the base styling aligns with the Numix aesthetic.**
* **Integration with JavaScript Frameworks (Consideration):** Explore potential integrations or guidelines for using Numix UI with popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, **while maintaining the core CSS principles inspired by Numix.**
* **Accessibility Enhancements:** Focus on improving the accessibility of all components, **adhering to best practices and considering any accessibility features present in Numix applications.**
* **Performance Optimization:** Further optimize the CSS for better performance.
* **Community Contributions:** Actively encourage and integrate community-developed components and features, **ensuring they align with the Numix design philosophy.**
* **Regular Maintenance and Updates:** Ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, and updates to ensure compatibility with modern browsers and web standards.
* **Release (v1.0.0 and beyond):** Major releases incorporating significant new features and improvements.

## Ongoing Efforts Across All Phases:

* **Community Engagement:** Actively solicit and respond to community feedback through issue tracking, discussions, and potential surveys.
* **Documentation Quality:** Continuously improve the clarity, accuracy, and completeness of the documentation, **explicitly mentioning the inspiration drawn from original Numix projects.**
* **Code Quality:** Maintain a clean, well-organized, and maintainable codebase.
* **Testing:** Implement more comprehensive testing strategies (unit, integration, and potentially visual regression testing).
* **Continuous Inspiration:** Regularly review and analyze the SCSS and design of original Numix projects to ensure Numix UI stays true to its source.
